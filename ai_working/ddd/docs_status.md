# Documentation Status - Phase 2 Complete

## Documents Created/Updated

### 1. Main Project Documentation
- ✅ `docs/parasol-task-management/README.md` - Complete project overview
- ✅ Architecture documentation with Clean/Hexagonal hybrid
- ✅ API reference with REST endpoints
- ✅ Domain model with entities and value objects

### 2. Parasol Integration Points

- ✅ Value-driven development approach
- ✅ Pattern library references
- ✅ Knowledge management strategy

### 3. Technical Documentation
- ✅ Installation and setup guide
- ✅ Configuration with environment variables
- ✅ Testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e)
- ✅ Deployment instructions (Docker, Kubernetes)

### 4. Domain Model Documentation

- ✅ User entity with capability mappings
- ✅ Project entity with value propositions and KPIs
- ✅ Value objects (TaskStatus, Priority)

## Next Steps

Documentation is ready for implementation. The documents now serve as the specification for the code implementation phase.

### To proceed to code planning:
Run `/ddd:3-code-plan` to create the implementation plan based on this documentation.

### Key Integration Points Documented:
1. **Parasol Capability Model**: Integrated into domain entities
2. **Value Metrics**: Added to Task and Project entities
3. **Pattern References**: Clean Architecture aligned with Parasol patterns
4. **Knowledge Management**: Metrics and monitoring setup

## Validation Checklist

- ✅ All entities have Parasol extensions
- ✅ API endpoints match capability operations
- ✅ Architecture aligns with Parasol hierarchical structure
- ✅ Metrics and KPIs are clearly defined
- ✅ Installation and deployment are documented

## Status: Ready for Code Planning

The documentation phase is complete and approved for the next phase.
